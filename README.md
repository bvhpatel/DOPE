# Data Organization Process Enhancer (DOPE)

A program that will assist investigators in formatting and organizing their data according to applicable standards.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Browser and Internet access
- Easier if you gather all your SPARC-related information before starting the process!

### Installing

First step is installing the SPARC Docker:

```
Follow instructions at https://github.com/cchorn/Docker_SPARC
```

Jupyter, Python and other tools are already included in this image. Future releases of the SPARC Docker might already include the DOPE tool!

```
Next step is locating the Jupyter notebook, selecting the proper checklist for your kind of data, and going through the validation process.
```

## Built With
* [Docker] (https://www.docker.com/) - Application deployment tool

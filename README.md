## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of DOPE up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Browser and Internet access

### Installing

1. Install **Anaconda** for Python version 3 for your operating system. Anaconda conveniently installs Python, Jupyter Notebook, and JupyterLab.

```
Follow instructions at https://www.anaconda.com/download/
```

2. Open the **Anaconda Prompt** (which is simply the Terminal if you are on macOS or Linux).

```
Follow instructions at https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#open-prompt-win
```

3. Install **nodejs** from the Anaconda Prompt.

```
Follow instructions at https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/nodejs
```

4. Install **ipywidgets** from the Anaconda Prompt. Make sure to follow the additional step for installing the JupyterLab extension.

```
Follow instructions at https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_install.html
```

5. Install the **Blackfynn python API** from the Anaconda Prompt.

```
Follow instructions at http://docs.blackfynn.io/python/latest/quickstart.html#installation
```

6. Download all **DOPE** files from the this Github repository (click "Clone or download" and select "Download ZIP").


7. In the Anaconda Prompt, type "jupyter lab" to launch JupyterLab.

8. Locate your DOPE files from the JupyterLab navigator. Open DOPE.ipynb from the "notebooks" folder of DOPE and **get started!**
